FROM ML to LLM WE CAN DO TEXT SUMMARIZATION

# INTORDUCTION : Text Summarization in Machine Learning

- What is text summary?
1. Text summarization : generating a conxise and precise summary 
2. Automatic text summarization aims to trasnform lenghty document to short version

- The need for text summarization 
1. mostly data is non-structured texual data -> need to summary, people get insights from them easily

## The main types of text summarization
- Extraction-based summarization 
: like highlishter, selects the main information from a source text 
    - In ml extractive summarization usually involves weighing the essential sections of essential section 

- Abstraction-based summarization
: advanced deep learing techniques are applied to paraphrase and shorten the original document
: abstractive machine learning algorithms can generate new phrases and sentences that represent the most important information form source text, assist in overcoming grammatical inaccuracies of the extraction techniques 

# How to perform text summarization 
- Step1 : Convert the paragraph into sentences 
- Step2 : Text processing 
- Step3 : Tokenization 
- Step4 : Evaluate the weighted occurence frequency of the words
- Step5 : Substitue words with their weighted frequencies
